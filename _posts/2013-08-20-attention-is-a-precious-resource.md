I had an MRI last week. While I was laying in the machine quietly
listening to the cacophony of clashes, clangs, beeps, and buzzes I was
surprised at how calm I felt.

Usually overwhelming, discordant noise really bothers and stresses me. I find it difficult to think or process and answering the simplest
of questions feels like a Herculean task.

But I didn't feel like that in the MRI.

Since I didn't have anything else to be doing, I thought about this and why
the noise here wasn't bothering me. Then, I realized that the answer was
in the question. I didn't have anything else to be doing.

I'm not stressed out by having too much noise, I'm stressed out by
having too many demands on my attention. The volume and discordancy
(generally from kids) is just a manifestation of demands on my
attention.

While I was laying there in the MRI, there was no other demand on my
attention. I could simply focus and be in the moment. I could ignore the
noise (not something I can do with kids) and just focus on my thoughts.

I think back on other times when I feel stressed and it's almost always
when there are too many demands on my attention. Tasks clamoring for
attention or people clamoring for answers or input. When I can just focus
on one thing at a time and move methodically from one task to another,
I'm much happier and less stressed.

Now, I'm trying to be in the moment. When I talk to someone, I'm
focused on the conversation, not reading emails. When I talk to one of my kids I
get down on their level so I can look them in the eye. When I'm finding
myself feeling overwhelmed, I take a deep breath and walk outside to
look at the trees. It only takes a couple minutes and I'm back at my desk feeling
better, and dealing with the demands one at a time.

I've never been very good at introspection, but I have to hope that
episodes like this help me be better. Recognizing what works well for me
helps me create a happier, healthier, more productive environment - for
both work and life.
