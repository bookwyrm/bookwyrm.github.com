I’m available for contracting for both front-end and back-end development.

I’ve been involved in web development since 1997. Since that time, I’ve worked with many Silicon Valley tech companies, both large and small.

I can take a Photoshop comp and turn it into a standards-compliant website that looks great in browsers down to IE7 (and is readable in IE6) or I can take a set of requirements and define and implement a backend solution to satisfy them.

Please [contact me](mailto:matt@vanderpol.net) about your project.

## Projects

Some recent projects I’ve worked on.

#### [vanderpol.net](http://vanderpol.net)

This site was recently re-imagined and relaunched. I wanted a place where I could promote my skills and capabilities as well as share my knowledge and give my own education a better framework. The site is built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), managed with [git](http://git-scm.com/) and served through [github pages](http://pages.github.com/). Having a static site like this frees me from having to maintain, secure, and update a hosting platform like WordPress and it allows me more flexibility in how I build the site. I’m only limited by my Ruby, JS, and CSS skills.

#### [Cedar House Sport Hotel Event Calendar](http://www.cedarhousesporthotel.com/eventcalendar/index.php)

I customized an existing open source event calendar to improve the security and “skinability” of the solution. I extended it to support a WYSIWYG interface for event descriptions and allow image uploads. I also improved the default search experience to make it more user friendly and accessible. The final solution was styled based on a provided comp and integrated with an existing website.

#### [qatab](http://qatab.com)

In all the years I’ve been a web developer, the process of collecting feedback and issues during the <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> phase has been fraught with difficulty. That’s why I created qatab. With qatab it’s easy for users to submit feedback or notes on what’s wrong and the qatab solution automatically captures time, URL and browser info - saving you from having to ask them for the specifics after the fact.

# Skillset

A high-level view of my skills in web development.

### HTML

The foundation of everything online is HTML. I use HTML5 for everything I do and ensure that it is all built on a semantic base. I know all about industry best practices and leverage them in everything I do. Whenever I’m creating a new website, I craft all of the markup before I start styling it so that I can ensure that tags are used appropriately and have the best SEO benefit.

### CSS

If HTML is the foundation, CSS is the paint and trim. Once I’ve built out the markup for the site, I start applying styles to match the comp. I always use the most modern techniques available that match the project requirements. Whenever possible, I’ll go with CSS3 for rounded corners, dropshadows, and more. I’ve implemented both complex designs for web applications with lots of moving parts and simple one page landing pages. I’m constantly reading and learning to stay abreast of the changes in this wildly-advancing field.

### JavaScript

Now we’re getting into behavior; JavaScript is what makes the page come alive. My JavaScript library of choice is [jQuery](jquery.com) but I’ve worked with others including [Ender](http://ender.no.de/) and [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/). I’ve implemented existing plugins for jQuery and created my own when necessary. I know all about how to improve page performance and can consult on that too.

### PHP

Ah, PHP - perhaps the most ubiquitous server-side technology online today. I’ve created many sites and solutions using PHP. I’ve extended both [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) and I’ve built my own framework for building and managing websites. If you’ve got a new or existing project in PHP I can help you.

### Ruby on Rails

I dabbled in Ruby on Rails several years ago but the technology stack felt a little too fragile to me. It’s matured quite a bit since then and I’m diving back in whole-heartedly. I created [qatab](http://qatab.com) in Rails and I’m excited to do more.

### Technology X

I’ve been called a gifted learner and I’m quick at picking up new languages, frameworks, and technologies. If you’ve got a project in a technology not mentioned here there’s a good chance that I’ve heard of it and dabbled some so I’d still love to chat with you about it and see if I can offer any insight or would be a good fit.
